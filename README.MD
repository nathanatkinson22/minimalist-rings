I pulled together some bits of code from a handful of other open source Fitbit watchfaces to create one that I really wanted.

## Features
This watchface works on both Ionic and Versa watches. It has the following features:

- Customizable color for time and date
- Stats displayed with icon: Steps, Stairs, Active Minutes, Calories
- "Rings" that show the progress of the stats listed above compared to the goal you set for each stat. When you complete a goal, the ring will be 100% (or greater) and will appear as a complete circle. No progress is marked after 100%. Note: the ring colors match the icon colors.
- A line at the top that shows battery status. The line shows both percentage and a color indicator. A full line indicates 100% battery. As the battery drains, the line will decrease in length. When it gets below 50%, the line turns yellow. Below 20%, the line turns red.



Let me know if you have any issues. This is my first clockface for a Fitbit watch, so I'm sure the code needs some cleaning up. Again, a lot of this code is borrowed from other clockfaces, so I don't take credit for most of the code in this clockface. Feel free to borrow, use, reuse, etc. any of the code here. Anything I copied from other clockfaces was released under the MIT license.
